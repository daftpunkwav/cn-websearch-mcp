/**
 * @file orchestrator
 * @description Search orchestration: single-source fallback chain (fallback) and multi-source aggregation (aggregate).
 *
 * Responsibilities:
 * - Single entry point runSearch: dispatch to fallback or aggregate by strategy
 * - Enforce the wall-clock timeout budget for each attempt via an abort signal
 * - Honor caller cancellation (MCP client disconnect) by aborting the search instead of walking the rest of the chain
 * - Retry transient failures once after a short backoff; assemble _meta (provider, latency, attempt audit) or a structured failure
 * - Under aggregate, query several providers in parallel, merge/dedupe by URL and tag sources
 * - Own the structured-failure taxonomy (no provider / all failed / cancelled) and the one predicate that recognises them
 */
