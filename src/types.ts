/**
 * @file types
 * @description Shared type contracts and vocabulary for the gateway (no imports, no I/O).
 *
 * Responsibilities:
 * - Define the normalized search result shape, per-attempt audit records, and merged
 *   multi-source metadata
 * - Define the search strategies, the search adapter interface, and the injectable search context
 * - Depend on no internal module itself; shared by the HTTP, normalization, orchestration,
 *   adapter and tool layers
 *
 * Design notes:
 * - It carries no logic, but it does own vocabulary: a name that more than one surface has to
 *   agree on lives here as a value, next to the type derived from it (see SEARCH_STRATEGIES).

 * strategy — config parsing, the MCP tool schema, the `--strategy` flag, the REPL — reads this
